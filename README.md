### What is Nomds?

Nomds is a bash script that creates a fake shell, where every command is invalid. 

<br>

### How to use:
- Installation | Find the "NoCmds" file in the folder and run the command: sudo cp NoCmds /usr/bin | Then run the command: sudo cd /usr/bin | Then run the command: sudo chmod +x NoCmds.
- Activaition | From anywhere you want, you can use the command NoCmds to activate the bash script. If you want to make it less suspicious you can use the command NoCmds -s to show a fake message from kali linux saying they no longer support this shell version.
- Deactivation | To use commands normaly again, type "nomds_gateway.c" to enable ctrl + c. If you did everything correctly you should be getting the response "-bash: nomds_gateway.c: unlocked shell brackets", if you see this message you know can use ctrl + c to leave the script.

> The bash script is trying to impersonate the normal shell but it is limited to what it can do.
<br>

#### Attention! :
> This script has been built for root users, some features might be disabled for a normal user.
